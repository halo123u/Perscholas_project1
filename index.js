She was the daughter of Lyra Erso, a devout member of the Church of the Force, and scientist Galen Erso, who was forced into helping the Galactic Empire build the Death Star. Erso's mother was killed when Director Orson Krennic, the commander of the Death Star project, kidnapped her fatherâ€”who affectionately referred to his daughter as Stardust. She was raised by resistance fighter Saw Gerrera and became a child soldier in his army.";
